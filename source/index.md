# `ArcGIS`

> There are a number of ways to authenticate with the platform - which include support for federated accounts and things like that. If you need anything other than a token, open an issue. We'll get there!

Initialize the client library session to access the API either as an anonymous user, or as an authenticated member of an organization. Calling `ArcGIS()` with no parameters will set up an instance of the platform that talks to ArcGIS Online as a public, anonymous user.

**Params:** JSON Object with the following options;

| Options        | Type         | Default                 |
| -------------- | ------------ | ----------------------- |
| token          | String       | none                    |
| domain         | URL          | www.arcgis.com/         |

**Returns:** JSON Object with ArcGIS methods.

```
{
  request: Function,      // Makes requests to the domain
  search: Function,       // Queries the API
  user: Function,         // Interact with a user
  organization: Function, // Interact with an org
  group: Function,        // Interact with a group
  item: Function,         // Interact with an item
  layer: Function,         // Interact with an layer
  map: Function,          // Interact with an map
  application: Function,  // Interact with an application
  file: Function,         // Interact with an file
  usage: Function         // Report usage
}
```

######
###### **Example**

> You can probably set up multiple of these suckers in one session to have access to public and private stuff at the same time.

```
var ArcGIS = require('arcgis')
<!-- Create an anonymous session with www.arcgis.com -->
var anonAGO = ArcGIS()
<!-- Create an authenticated session with www.arcgis.com -->
var authAGO = ArcGIS({
	token: token
})
<!-- Creat an anonymous session with ArcGIS Server -->
var serverGIS = ArcGIS({
	domain: 'myGIS.myurl.com'
})
```

---

## `request`

> Request has a lot of functionality that I've been told we need, but I'm really not sure that any of it is. Right now, this barebones request works fine. As it stops working fine, we'll add more to it.

Request uses information in the client to make calls to the API. It takes a url substring, a JSON object, and a boolean.

Request appends the URL to the clients domain and the omnipresent 'sharing/rest'. The JSON object gets processed into parameters. The boolean defines the request is GET (default, false) or POST (true). Request also appends the token that the current client session is authenticated with, and defines the response format as JSON.

Some services - like usage, analysis, things like that â€“ require a different root URL, since they are an independent API. Passing a root URL in as the fourth param will replace the standard Root.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Default |
| -- | -- | -- |
| url | String | / |
| form | Object | {} |
| post | Boolean | false |
| rootURL | String | `${domain}/sharing/rest` |

**Response:**
Promise that resolves to whatever the endpoint returns.


###### **Example**
```
arcgis.request()
.then( function (results) {
    <!-- This calls the endpoint self, and returns a version number of the API. -->
	console.log(results)
})
```

---

## `search`

> this is growing in support as needed

Searches for SQL queries against the api.

**Params:**
Query String, Results per Page, Page, Sort By, Sort Order

| Param | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| queryString | '\"\"'' | String, what to search for. Can be [complicated.](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/search.htm) |
| num | 100 | Results per page |
| page | 0 | Page of results to return |
| sort | 'created' | Field to sort results on |
| order | 'desc' | 'asc' or 'desc', ascending or descending |

**Results:**
Promise that resolves to a Paginated search results Object

```
{
  nextStart: Number,  // if -1, there are no more results
  num: Number,        // Number of items per page returned
  query: String,      // The query string that got us here
  results: Array,     // An array of all the items that match the query
  start: Number,      // The index of the item that starts this batch of results
  total: Number,      // Total number of items that match the query
  pages: Number,      // How many pages of results there are
  currentPage: Number // Index of the current page
}
```


###### **Example**
```
arcgis.search('owner:NikolasWise AND (type:"Feature Service")', 100)
.then(function(results) {
  console.log(results)
})

```

---

## `user`

> Every method off `ArcGIS()` returns a promise, and involve making requests to the domain.

This object us used to interact with a user - your own user account, other users in your organization, or publicly available users that are not associated with your organization. This method is also used to create new users by inviting them to your organization.

**Params:**
A username string

| Params         | Type         | Default                 |

.then(function (user){
  console.log(user)
})
```

### `user.update`

Takes an options object, and sets the users information to the options provided. Returns an error, or the updated user object.

**Params:**
Options JSON Object

| Options        | Type         | Description             |

	var options = {description: 'just this person, you know?'}
	return user.update(options)
})
.then(function (user) {
  console.log(user)
})
```

### `user.content`

> This is _not_ using the user content method from the ArcGIS API. Instead, this is using a the [`search`](#search) method and pre-filling the parameters to locate the current user's content. This is done to have all content calls share response properties. The raw user content api call is the only call in the platform that does not return a paginated results object.

Returns an array of all of the users items and folders. If passed a folder id, will return an array of the items in that folder. These items have the same static properties as the results of [`item`](#item), but do not have methods attached to them.

**Params:**
Flolder ID, Results per Page, Page, Sort By, Sort Order

| Params         | Default      | Description             |
| -------------- | ------------ | ----------------------- |
| folder         | /       | Folder of content to return  |
| num | 100 | Results per page |
| page | 0 | Page of results to return |
| sort | 'created' | Field to sort results on |
| order | 'desc' | 'asc' or 'desc', ascending or descending |

**Returns:**
Promise that resolves to a [`search` results object](#search).

```
{
  nextStart: Number,  // if -1, there are no more results
  num: Number,        // Number of items per page returned
  query: String,      // The query string that got us here
  results: Array,     // An array of all the items that match the query
  start: Number,      // The index of the item that starts this batch of results
  total: Number,      // Total number of items that match the query
  pages: Number,      // How many pages of results there are
  currentPage: Number // Index of the current page
}
```


###### **Example**
```
arcgis.user(username)
.then(function (user) {
	return user.content()
})
.then(function (results) {
  console.log(results)
})
```

### `user.favorites`

Users store their their favorite items in a group associated with their account. Getting a users favorites is similar to getting any other groups content.

**Params:**
Results per Page, Page, Sort By, Sort Order

| Params         | Default      | Description             |
| -------------- | ------------ | ----------------------- |

| page | 0 | Page of results to return |
| sort | 'created' | Field to sort results on |
| order | 'desc' | 'asc' or 'desc', ascending or descending |

**Returns:**
Promise that resolves to a [`search` results object](#search).

```
{
	num: Number,       // Total number of items that could be returned
	total: Number,     // Total number of items in favorites
	query: String,     // Search string used to get these
	start: Number,     // Which item this page starts with
	nextStart: Number, // Which item next page starts with.
	results: Array     // Item objects
}
```

###### **Example**
```
arcgis.user(username)
.then(function (user) {
	return user.favorites()
})
.then(function (results) {
  console.log(results)
})
```

### `user.enabled`

Enables and disables the user within the organization. Passing no boolean to the method will return the current state of the user.

If a user is disabled, that means that their account is not active, but has not been deleted. A disabled user still counts towards your organizations maximum number of users.

**Params:**
Enabled

| Params         | Type         | Default                 |
| -------------- | ------------ | ----------------------- |
| User Enabled   | Boolean      | none                    |

**Returns:**
Promise that resolves to the updated [`user`](#user) object.

###### **Example**

```
arcgis.user(username)
.then(function (user) {
	return user.enabled(false)
})
.then(function (user) {
  console.log(user)
})
```

### `user.delete`

Deletes the user. This cannot be undone.

**Returns:**
Promise that resolves to an confirmation object.

###### **Example**
```
arcgis.user(username)
.then(function (user) {
	return user.delete()
})
.then(function (confirmation) {
  console.log(confirmation)
})
```

## `organization`

> Organizations are the central entities in the ArcGIS platform. All users belong to an Organization.

This object us used to interact with an Organization within the domains Portal - ArcGIS Online for example has many organizations that can be interacted with. An on-premises version of Portal or Server may have fewer, if not just one.

Calling the function without any parameters will create an object that interacts with the organization that is currently authenticated. Calling the function with an organizations ID will interact with that organization from the perspective of a public user.

**Params:**
String of an Org Id.

| Params         | Type         | Default                 |

<!-- Creates an object with methods for interacting with a given org -->
```

### `organization.get`

All the inÂ­forÂ­maÂ­tion asÂ­soÂ­ciÂ­ated with an organization that the current session has access too.

## `group`

> In the ArcGIS platform, groups are used to aggregate users and content together. They can contain items and users from outside organizations, be authorized to access applictions and content purchased from [the marketplace](https://marketplace.arcgis.com/), and are used to manage things like user favorites and featured content.
